Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow’s genetics have given rise to many other legends like White Russian, White Rhino, and Blue Widow.

Its flowers are dressed in bright orange hairs and a thick white coat of trichomes that contrasts dramatically against the deep emerald hue of the foliage. Wild Thailand is profoundly stimulating and should be avoided by those prone to anxiety.

If you were to ask growers, they would say it’s the plant’s impressive high yields. If you were to ask users, they would probably cite the length of its sativa dominant buzz. Either way, this strain is a popular lady. Wonder Woman is a possible cross of Ice and another hybrid that can produce both a sativa and an indica dominant plant. Growing-wise, the sativa tends to grow taller than the indica, but both are prized for their very high yields and resilience. On average, plants will flower in 9 to 11 weeks, producing copious amounts of tight little buds that make for easy trimming.
